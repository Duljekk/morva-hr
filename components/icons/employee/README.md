# Employee-Specific Icons

This directory contains icon components specific to the employee-facing side of the application.

## Examples of Employee Icons

- Check-in/Check-out icons
- Leave type icons (Annual, Sick, Unpaid)
- Employee dashboard icons
- Profile and personal settings icons

## Creating Employee Icons

Follow the same template pattern as other icons:

1. Copy `../IconTemplate.tsx`
2. Rename to match your icon (e.g., `CheckIn.tsx`)
3. Update the component name and props interface
4. Add your optimized SVG paths
5. Export from `../index.ts`

## Template

See `../IconTemplate.tsx` for the complete template structure.
